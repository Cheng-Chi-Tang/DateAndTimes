# DifferenceBtwDates
- In this Repository, I implement some tools to calculate the diffence between two different dates.
- For example, given two dates 2019-10-20 21:00 and 2019-11-20 15:00, how many hours between them?
- Moreover, given two dates 2019-10-20 21:00 and 2019-11-20 15:00, how to generate all intervals betweens them (2019-10-20 22:00, 2019-10-20 23:00, ..., 2019-11-20 13:00, 2019-11-20 14:00)
